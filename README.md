# README

- In the current world, we are going through a lot of negative news that might affect our well-being. I believe that many sources are not highlighting the number of recovered Coronavirus cases and hence, this extension would allow the user to see the number of recovered cases and percentage of recoveries out of all the cases. This is meant to spread some positivity during this pandemic. The user can also get an idea about the pandemic in a particular country by looking at the recovery rate as the recovery rate would increase as the pandemic gets over.

# Features

- The side bar on the right side shows the information and the API information is fetched every few hours to reflect the latest changes.

- Choose "Get Corona Update" and then input the country you want to look at. The information will show up in your statusbar.

- Enter "Global" or "global" to get information about the whole world

- If the input box is left blank, the Global stats are displayed to the user

- The Extension uses [Coronavirus COVID19 API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc) for getting the information

**Enjoy!**
